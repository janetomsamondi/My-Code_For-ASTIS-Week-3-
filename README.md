IMAGE DETECTION MODEL
i have applied CNN which is a class of deep learning to analyze visual imagery in this case
in this field the network employs a mathematical operation called convolution
convolution is a mathematical operation on two functions that produces a third function that expresses how the shape of one is modified by the other
in my image, which i can say looks like a painting includes birds photos in different colours and shapes
the network succesfully recognize the birds faces and clearly detects them




i have used the model to claerly identify bird images from the photo.
